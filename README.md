## Unix History

* Shell Scripting was developed in the context of the UNIX Operating System from Bell Labs

* Early UNIX systems packed incredible power into very small machines
  * 64 Kb "virtual" address space for the code and for data
  * This was often less than that of physical memory on the early [PDP-11S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11)
* Source Code made it easy to experiment and change the system
* AT&T Bell Labs heavily influenced Unix by the likes of [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson), [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie), and others

Quote from Dennis Ritchie for Vision of Unix:

> What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal computing, as supplied by remote-access, time-shared machines, is not just to type programs into a terminal instead of a keypunch, but to encourage close communication.

* Unix Developers were the users of the system and they developed tools to solve their own problems
* Unix Developers were given freedom to experiment and rewrite Unix as needed
* Unix was designed in a quest for elegance
